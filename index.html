    <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            <p>Hello! My username is kaijos. My hobbies include reading/writing poetry, gaming, music, and spending time with my friends and family.</p>
        <h2>Is it your first time in post-secondary education? If no, what did you study?</h2>
            <p>Nope! I recently completed the Office Administration Assistant 1 certificate with NIC, which I did online. I also went to Camosun back in 2019 for a semester in a computer science program.</p>
        <h2>Do you have any past experience of creating websites? If yes, please explain.</h2>
            <p>Besides that semester at Camosun, I have none. I do remember enjoying the HTML classes the most, hence why I'm trying it again; this time, with NIC!</p>
        <h2>Do you know any coding languages? If yes, which ones?</h2>
            <p>No. I don't remember my previous courses well enough to say I do.</p>
        <h2>What are your goals for this course?</h2>
            <p>I would like to get good enough grades that I can apply for scholarships again in the future if I decide to go back to school. I also want to learn how to build websites for personal use.</p>
